      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        I like to watch anime, so I want to find out the trends of popular anime. That would be interesting to know what
        factors make anime great and bad. Also, I want to visualize why I like a certain kind of anime and why I donâ€™t
        like a certain kind of anime too. After analyzing anime trends, I can convince myself and my friends why the
        anime is good to watch objectively.
