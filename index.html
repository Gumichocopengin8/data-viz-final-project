      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        I like to watch anime, so I want to find out the trends of popular anime. That would be interesting to know what
        factors make anime great and bad. Also, I want to visualize why I like a certain kind of anime and why I donâ€™t
        like a certain kind of anime too. After analyzing anime trends, I can convince myself and my friends why the
        anime is good to watch objectively.

      <h2>Anime Type Count</h2>
      <iframe title="Inline Frame Example" width="100%" height="850px" src="./count_anime_type_pie_chart.html">
      </iframe>
      <p>
        TV, OVA, and Movie categories ocupy more than 75% of the graph. Undoubtedly, TV is the most popular category.
        Derived anime from original anime called OVA is also popular due to the original anime. Usually the popular
        anime becomes movie series to extend the story, so these 3 categories are pretty much the same things.

      <h2>Average Episodes of Each Anime Type</h2>
      <iframe title="Inline Frame Example" width="100%" height="720px" src="./average_episodes_of_each_type.html">
      </iframe>
      <p>
        TV series average episodes is 33 episodes which is almost 3 seasons. However, OVA's average episodes is only 2.3
        episodes. OVA are usually short series because it is not directly related to the original story. Meanwhile, ONA
        is a little bit longer than OVA. Music anime is not popular at all.

      <h2>Scatterplot between Episodes and Rating (Interactice Graph)</h2>
      <iframe
        title="Inline Frame Example"
        width="100%"
        height="750px"
        src="./popularity_average_episode_scatterplot.html"
      >
      </iframe>
      <p>
        This is a scatterplot graph to find out the relationship between episodes and rating. The total episodes of the
        popular TV series with over 8 rating tend to have less than 200 episodes. If the number of episodes go higher
        than 200, new users usually hesitate to watch a whole series. Also, there are weal positive correlation in all
        categories.
