# Anime Trends

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to analyze anime trends. I found data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/CooperUnion/anime-recommendations-database). So far, I have analyzed media type distribution, the average episodes of each media type, and relationship between rating and the number of episodes.

## Getting Stated
